Re**Science** is a peer-reviewed journal that target computational research and
encourage the explicit reproduction of already published research promoting new
and open-source implementations in order to ensure the original research is
reproducible.To achieve such a goal, the whole editing chain is radically
different from any other traditional scientific journal. Re**Science** lives on
[github](https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience/wiki) where each new
implementation is made available together with the comments, explanations and
tests. Each submission takes the form of a pull request that is publicly
reviewed and tested in order to guarantee any researcher can re-use it. If you
ever reproduced computational result from the literature, Re**Science** is the
perfect place to publish this new implementation.
